# Contributing
New Contributors are always welcome!

## Contributor Agreement
Most Contributors are [members](https://www.openhwgroup.org/membership/) of the
OpenHW Group and participate in one or more [Technical Task Groups](https://www.openhwgroup.org/working-groups/).
Membership is strongly encouraged, but not required.
Contributors must be covered by the terms of the [Eclipse Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/ECA.php)
(for individuals) **or** the [Eclipse Member Committer and Contributor Agreement](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/committer_process/EclipseMemberCommitterAgreement.pdf)
(for employees of Member companies).
The ECA/MCCA provides a legal framework for a Contributor's technical contributions to the OpenHW Group,
including provisions for grant of copyright license and a Developer
Certificate of Origin on contributions merged into OpenHW Group repositories.
